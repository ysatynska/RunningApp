# Running App
### This ReactNative app will be created by a group of students for CPSC270 course at Roanoke College.
##### Problem to solve:
###### Running can help us stay fit and healthy. Lots of people run on a daily basis and a little bit of structure to their workouts could improve its efficiency. This app will be designed to let users track their workouts, will provide a potential schedule of the workouts for them and adjust it according to the progress made so far.
